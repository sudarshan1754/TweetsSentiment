                        # About Dataset and Initial Setup #
###********************************************************************************###

The folder "datasets" includes two datasets namely; "ds1" and "ds2". ds1 maps to
Dataset-1 and ds2 maps to Dataset-2 in the report.

I have made use of Python 2.7.3 programming/scripting environment.
Note: It is better to use an IDE such as Pycharm to run the program. You can download the
      free(community edition) version of the IDE from this link:
      http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Before running the program, please install the Natural Language Toolkit from this link:

                            # FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS #
###********************************************************************************###

"SentimentNaiveBayes.py" file is the executable file which contains the program for
this assignment.

Execution:
    In the terminal type: python SentimentNaiveBayes.py

    Once you run the program, it will ask you for the path/directory name of
    positive files and then the negative files, as shown below:

        Enter the positive train file path:<path_of_positive_train_file>
        Enter the negative train file path:<path_of_negative_train_file>
        Enter the positive test file path:<path_of_positive_test_file>
        Enter the negative test file path:<path_of_positive_test_file>

    Once these are provided, the program runs on the data and displays the results
    in the terminal/IDE.

                            # FOR BASELINE ANALYSIS #
###********************************************************************************###

"baseline.py" file is the executable file which contains the program for baseline
analysis.

Execution:
    In the terminal type: python baseline.py

    Once you run the program, it will ask you for the path/directory name of
    the positive keywords file, negative keywords file along with positive test file
    and then the negative test file, as shown below:


        Enter the positive keywords file path: <path_of_positive-words_file>
        Enter the negative keywords file path: <path_of_negative-words_file>
        Enter the positive test file path: <path_of_positive_test_file>
        Enter the negative test file path: <path_of_negative_test_file>

    Once these are provided, the program runs on the data and displays the results
    in the terminal/IDE.

    Note: positive keywords file, negative keywords file are included in the folder
          "dictionary"
